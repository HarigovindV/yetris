Things I must do later
======================

* Save and restore game state
  (binary file with info on all major game data structures)
  (save with, idk, F10, and restore with --restore commandline)

* Improve coding style
  (document even more and clean stupid hacks on the code)

* Give tons of flags to the 'global' data structure
  (must know exactly what's happening through bool flags)
