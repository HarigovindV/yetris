yetris README for Windows
=========================

yetris is Tetris(tm) on the console. It has colors and highscore, along with
many features found on modern Tetris(tm) implementations.
It's made with C and runs on (most) Linux terminals.

Some of it's features:
	* Colored textual interface - playable on the console.
	* Hold and up to 5 next pieces.
	* Combo and back-to-back sequences
	* Scoring system compliant to the (conjectured) Tetris(tm) Guideline.

For now it attempts to be as close as any modern Tetris(tm) game as possible.
It lacks some expected features but it's on active development.

Also, the source code is clean and commented, allowing much better
understanding and easing feature-implementation.

CANNOT COMPILE TO WINDOWS BECAUSE IT DOESNT HAVE select()
AND PDCURSES DOESNT HAVE mvwvhline() GOD-DAMNIT
