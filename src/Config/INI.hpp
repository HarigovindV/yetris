/// Loads settings from a file with `.ini` configuration format.
///
/// ## INI file
///
/// An `.ini` file has sections, keys and values.
/// Like:
///
///     ; comment style 1
///     # comment style 2
///     [section]
///     key = value
///     [section2]
///     key2 = value2
///
/// It is mandatory that all keys are stored within sections.
/// Blank lines are allowed.
///
/// Sections and keys are case-insensitive.
/// Values can be:
///
/// * Boolean: yes/no, YES/NO, true/false, TRUE/FALSE, 1/0
/// * Integer: 42 (decimal), 042 (octal), 0x42 (hex)
/// * Double: 1.12321, 543.92502
/// * String: any sequence of characters to the end of line
///
/// ## Usage
///
///     INI ini;
///     if (! ini.load("filename.ini"))
///         // Woops, something bad happened.
///         // File doensn't exist, whatever
///     bool var = ini.get("section1:booleanValue", true);
///     int otherVar = ini.get("section2:intValue", 2);
///     std::string another = ini.get("section3:string", "4");
///
/// ## get() path format
///
/// Suppose you have an ini file like this:
///
///     [section1]
///     key = value
///     [section2]
///     otherKey = 2
///
/// Then to get() the first value you should ask with the
/// string "section1:key".
/// For the second, it should be "section2:otherKey".
