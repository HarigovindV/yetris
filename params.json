{"name":"yetris","tagline":"Tetris(tm) on the console","body":"### Welcome to yetris\r\nFrom the same creator of [nSnake](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnake/), yetris is a Tetris(tm) clone in the terminal. It has colors and highscore, along with many features found on modern Tetris(tm) implementations. It's made with ncurses on C and runs on (most) Linux terminals.\r\n\r\nSome features:\r\n* Colored textual interface - playable on the console;\r\n* Hold and up to 5 next pieces;\r\n* Combo and back-to-back sequences;\r\n* Scoring system compliant to the (conjectured) Tetris(tm) Guideline;\r\n\r\nFor now it attempts to be as close as any modern Tetris(tm) game as possible. It lacks some expected features but it's on active development.\r\n\r\nAlso, the source code is clean and commented, allowing much better understanding and easing feature-implementation.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\n$ cd yetris_folder/\r\n$ make\r\n$ make install\r\n\r\n# If you want to test the game first\r\n$ make run\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n![game screen](https://sourceforge.net/p/yetris-yetris/screenshot/yetris.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors, Support and Contact\r\nThank you for having interest on this project!
